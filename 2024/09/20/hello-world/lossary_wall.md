## 𝐒𝐮𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐬𝐞𝐝 𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠:
𝐒𝐮𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐬𝐞𝐝 𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 is like having a teacher. You already know the answers (labeled data), and the goal is to help the computer learn to predict the right answer when given new data. Two types of tasks are done here:
 
## 𝐔𝐧𝐬𝐮𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐬𝐞𝐝 𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠: 
𝐔𝐧𝐬𝐮𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐬𝐞𝐝 𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 when no teacher is here! It’s like figuring out patterns in the wild. The computer tries to make sense of the data by grouping or organizing it.
 
## 𝐒𝐞𝐦𝐢-𝐒𝐮𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐬𝐞𝐝 𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠:
𝐒𝐞𝐦𝐢-𝐒𝐮𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐯𝐢𝐬𝐞𝐝 𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠: It’s a mix of both supervised and unsupervised. The computer learns from a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data—like learning with limited guidance.
 
## 𝐑𝐞𝐢𝐧𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐜𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠
𝐑𝐞𝐢𝐧𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐜𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭 𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐫𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 is like learning from mistakes and rewards. Imagine a kid learning to ride a bike—when they fall, they learn to balance better next time. Examples: Q-Learning, Policy Optimization.
 
## Automated Machine Learning 
Automated Machine Learning is estimated to grow from USD 1.0 billion in 2023 to USD 6.4 billion by 2028, at a CAGR of 44.6%
